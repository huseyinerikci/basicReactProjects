# Northwind Store
Northwind Store is a simple shopping application where you can list products by category and add or remove them from the cart. The application was developed with React's Class Component structure, and data was retrieved from JSON Server with fetch. React Router was used to navigate between pages, and notifications were added to user interactions with the Alertify library.
