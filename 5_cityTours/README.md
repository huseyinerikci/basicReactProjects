# City Tours
City Tours is a React application that provides information about city tours and allows users to manage tours on the screen. The application presents city tours in a list, each tour can be deleted and all data is stored in a JSON file. When the page is refreshed, added and deleted tours are saved in the file.
The application is developed using React and React-Sass and icons are added with Font Awesome.
