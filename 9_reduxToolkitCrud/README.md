# Redux Toolkit CRUD and Counter Application
This project is a CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) and Counter application developed using React.js, Redux Toolkit, React Router DOM and React Bootstrap. Our aim in developing the project is to learn how to use Redux Toolkit and to master the application development process. In addition, the project also includes responsive design and theme change features.
